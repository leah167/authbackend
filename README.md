### Approach

- Part 1 - Server
  - First, we will create an express server and hook it up to our mongo database.
  - Second, we will install the encryption node module bcrypt.
    - bcrypt gives us access to password generation and authentication funcionality for logging users in to our application.
  - Third, we will implement the user creation route using the bcrypt salt/hash functions to take our new users password and encrypt it before saving it to the database.
  - Fourth, we will implement the user login route to authenticate our user with the bcrypt compare function.
  - Fifth, we will create a put route for editing user permissions (this is the sort of thing that would only be reserved for admins) so that we may grant administrator status to our users.
  - Sixth, we will create a simple route that returns a JSON success object, but only after the user has authenticated and is authorized to view the resource.

### Requirements (Back-End - Boilerplate)

- Create a new github repo called authbackend, clone the repo to your computer and add the link to populi. Note: when you create this repository, you must add a README, and a node .gitignore template.

- Initialize the repo with express-generator.
  - npx express-generator .
- Create a new file ./.env and add the following environment variable to it
  - PORT=4000
  - Note: This will change the server port to 4000 on startup
- [Optional] Install nodemon on the server and add the custom dev command in the package.json
  - npm i nodemon
  - "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www",
    "dev": "nodemon ./bin/www"
    }
- Install the CORS package by running "npm i cors" in ./
  - npm i cors
- Add the followng code, after the line var app = express();, to app.js:
  - //enable cors
    const cors = require("cors");
    app.use(cors());
    app.options("\*", cors());
- Install mongodb and dotenv
  - npm i mongodb dotenv
- Add your Mongo Atlas connection string to the ./.env file
  - MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<myusername>:<mypassword>@<mycluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    - Note: You will need to replace <myusername>, <mypassword>, and <mycluster> with the values for your URI string.
  - Add the default blog name to the .env file
    - MONGO_DATABASE=blog
- Create a new file ./mongo.js and add the following code to it:

  - const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");
    require("dotenv").config();

    let db;

    async function mongoConnect() {
    const uri = process.env.MONGO_URI;
    const client = new MongoClient(uri);
    try {
    await client.connect();
    db = await client.db(process.env.MONGO_DATABASE);
    console.log("db connected");
    } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    }
    }
    function blogsDB() {
    return db;
    }
    module.exports = {
    mongoConnect,
    blogsDB,
    };

- Add the following code, after the line var app = express();, to app.js:
  - var { mongoConnect } = require('./mongo.js');
    mongoConnect();

### Requirements (Back-End - User-Creation)

- Second, we will install the encryption node module bcrypt.
  - bcrypt gives us access to password generation and authentication funcionality for logging users in to our application.
- Third, we will implement the user creation route using the bcrypt salt/hash functions to take our new users password and encrypt it before saving it to the database.

- In the root ./, install bcryptjs and uuidv4
  - npm i bcryptjs uuidv4
  - Note:
    - Here are the bcrypt docs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs
    - Here are the uuidv4 docs: https://github.com/thenativeweb/uuidv4#readme
- In app.js add the following code:
  - var authRouter = require('./routes/auth');
  - app.use('/auth', authRouter);
- Create a new file ./routes/auth.js and implement the following in it:
  - Add these lines of code to the top of the file:
    - var express = require("express");
      var router = express.Router();
      const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
      const { uuid } = require('uuidv4');
      const { blogsDB } = require("../mongo");
  - Add this line to the bottom of the file:
    - module.exports = router
  - Write a new async(!) function in the global scope called createUser. Implement the following in createUser:
    - Add two params to the function definition: username and passwordHash
      - const createUser = async (username, passwordHash) => {}
    - Add this line of code to connect to the users collection:
      - const collection = await blogsDB().collection("users")
      - Note: You do not have to create the users collection in mongodb before saving to it. Mongo will automatically create the users collection upon insert of a new document.
    - Implement mongodb functionality to insert() the user into the collection:
      - const user = {
        username: username,
        password: passwordHash,
        uid: uuid() // uid stands for User ID. This will be a unique string that we will can to identify our user
        }
    - Add a try catch block within your code to return true if the save was successful and false if it was not:
      - try {
        // Save user functionality
        return true;
        } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return false;
        }
  - Create a new async(!) POST route "/auth/register-user" and implement the following:
    The user's username and password will come from the req.body in this request
    - const username = req.body.username
    - const password = req.body.password
    - Add these lines to generate a salted hash of your users password and save the new user to the database
      - const saltRounds = 5; // In a real application, this number would be somewhere between 5 and 10
        const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds)
        const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt)
        const userSaveSuccess = await createUser(username, hash);
    - Respond at the end of the route with a json success object
      - res.json({success: userSaveSuccess})
  - Create a new async POST route "/auth/login-user" and implement the following:
    - Add mongodb code to fetch a user from the database where the username matches the incoming username from req.body
      - const user = await collection.findOne({
        username: req.body.username
        })
    - Add the following code to check the users stored password with the req.body password:
      - const match = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);
    - Implement functionality at the end of the route to respond a json object. If the passwords match, then the object should have "success": true; if the passwords do not match, the object should have "success": false.
